# Django Blog Template    
This template has been created as an extremely stripped down version of starting a blog Django template.  No bells, no whistles, just the stripped down version of a new Django project with a Blog app (containing the blog components), and an Index app (containing common components, such as navbar, footer and index.html)

## Table of Contents

## General


## How to Use
The views in this project use Class-based views for ease of deploying multiple pages and making use of the awesome get_context_data and get_queryset functions inherited from the ListView and DetailView classes.

## How to Adapt
### Django Components
#### Adding New Blog Models

#### Customise Existing Models

### Styling
This project has been built in CSS; no libraries like bootstrap or anything (though I wish I had)

## Deployment
I hate deploying this stuff... so please bear with me as I fudge my way through a step-by-step method of hosting on the services below.
### Heroku
